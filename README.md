# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Statistics and Chinese.
- I am taking STATS 220 as I would like to expand and build on my existing skillset. Whislt gaining a greater understanding of data : aquasition, storage and processing.
- I am intrested in learning the various ways data can be aquired , manipulated and visually portrayed. 

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExMmtqYWJndDl5aWM0cXh1bG8zMXdmb2N5NmMyMGZqd2hlY3cxbGJ4NyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/G4Ihli2UThrBS/giphy.gif)
